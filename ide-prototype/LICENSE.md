# The Graphl License

You may not distribute a commercial product that embeds the Graphl IDE
without entering into an agreement with Graphl Technologies or its creator,
Michael Belousov. An incomplete list of examples of "embeddings" includes loading
the official Graphl IDE in a webview, an iframe, or linking the native SDK into
an application.

Embeddings of the Graphl IDE into a non-commercial application is not restricted.
An example of a non-commercial application is one distributed under an OSI-approved
open source license.

Advising someone to use an official Graphl IDE (<a href="https://graphl.tech/app">https://graphl.tech/app</a>,
or the native IDE app distributions) to directly import a library which integrates with a separate commercial entity
does not constitute an embedding and is therefore unrestricted by this license.

You may use the IDE in any application provided to you by an authorized distributor,
such as <a href="https://graphl.tech/app">https://graphl.tech/app</a> which is free
to use, but not embed. In fact, if you are just an end-user using the Graphl editor,
you are beholden only to the restrictions of your distributor, which for
<a href="https://graphl.tech/app">https://graphl.tech/app</a> is described in the first
paragraph.

You have the exclusive and complete rights to anything you create with an official Graphl IDE,
and we will never take that away from you. You may export, modify, copy, etc, code that
you wrote in Graphl. Be sure to check the licenses of any imported code if they have any restrictions
on usage.

Other authorized distributors of a commercially embedded Graphl IDE may not give you the same rights, so
please refer to their terms.
