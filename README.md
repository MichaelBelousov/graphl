## ideas

- immutable expressions can be out of order
- reroute nodes are variables
- comments are variables
- use single quotes to delimit variables? (to allow for arbitrary text for variable names)
- arrays of size 4 or less automatically have the rgba and xyzw swizzle attributes ala GLSL
- you can sync node graphs
- needs to have a graph layout algorithm for generating a graph from text rather than syncing
- needs to have deterministic automatic naming for node graphs
- maybe fold symmetric expressions
- need an isomorphism for groups but still with the ability to access variables between them
