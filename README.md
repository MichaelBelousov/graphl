## Graphl

Graphl is a programming language and associated embeddable visual IDE.
Currently the main execution backend is a compiler to [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/).

It is very early and experimental but capable and we'd be happy to help you make it work for you!

## Goals:

- two-way conversion from text to visual and back
- authoritative formatter for both textual and visual representation
- lisp-like macros over graphs for things like:
    - emulating other graph-based scripting systems or workflow engines
    - visual SQL query building
    - etc
- lightweight backends for browser use
- embed easily anywhere: web applications, native applications, etc
- package manager
- easy interop with other webassembly binaries

## Non goals:

- the best programming language to work in textually

## WIP:

- standard library
- a lot
