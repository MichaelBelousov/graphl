This is a trick question... there are plenty!
Here is a sample of some different visual scripting systems, some you may have heard of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/geometry_nodes/index.html&quot;&gt;Blender nodes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/introduction-to-blueprints-visual-scripting-in-unreal-engine&quot;&gt;Unreal Engine Blueprints&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/blockly/&quot;&gt;Scratch/Google Blockly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.grasshopper3d.com/page/tutorials-1&quot;&gt;Grasshopper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://unit.software&quot;&gt;unit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/IndiePython/nodezator&quot;&gt;nodezator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;every no-code workflow engine ever&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they don&apos;t suck, but honestly, I think some parts might suck... kinda.
Why is visual programming so much less popular than textual programming languages like JavaScript and Python, anyway?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps, a better question might be:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TODO: different font --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why can you use languages like JavaScript or Python in websites, browser extensions, servers,
microcontrollers, minecraft, Figma, etc... And yet you can only run Unreal Engine&apos;s Blueprint visual
scripting language inside the Unreal Engine editor?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can&apos;t even write your own blueprints and run them in an Unreal Engine-based game!
(although a few mod systems with Epic&apos;s blessing seem to have a form of this).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer as far as I can tell is three-fold:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People don&apos;t design visual languages to be used at scale.
They create them as a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language&quot;&gt;Domain-Specific Language (DSL)&lt;/a&gt;
for users that are less familiar with big code-based projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Visual scripting is usually implemented in a limited scope, with less resources,
often with a simplistic interpreter since performance isn&apos;t a concern&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Some visual scripts translate to a more common textual language (like JavaScript).
&lt;a href=&quot;https://studio.retejs.org/&quot;&gt;Rete Studio&lt;/a&gt;) does this, and today they explicitly say it is in beta, recommending you
&quot;&lt;em&gt;verify that the obtained graph is correctly converted into code that reflects the original code&quot;!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote1&quot;&gt;&lt;super&gt;1&lt;/super&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the real problem is a social intertia one. The people building these things have been using textual
languages since computers had too little memory for anything else, and don&apos;t plan on stopping. Very few people
have considered building a visual language for anything serious. No one, as far I can tell, has even made
a visual language that can be freely embedded in other hosts. Even if it &quot;works in any web site&quot;, you can&apos;t
write a game engine or engineering application that scripts with it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So instead people chasing serious visual scripting seem to go with option 3. I&apos;ve seen few attempts and little
success with option 3. And on top of that, they&apos;re now converting to a complex language like JavaScript with its
own complex semantics and often heavy-weight runtime dependency.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why is it hard to convert visual graphs to an existing language?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How hard can it be to make a graph representation that converts to JavaScript or Python?
I will leave a lot of the detail for a future post, but here is a summary:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&apos;s tempting to base the visual graph on the language&apos;s AST, but ASTs are &lt;em&gt;Abstract Syntax TREES&lt;/em&gt;, they aren&apos;t graphs,
and they don&apos;t represent control flow. Even simplifications of the AST tend to lack things that make visual programming
attractive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a truly graph-like visual scripting language you can intuitively jump back to previous code sections,
but the equivalent in programming languages &lt;em&gt;goto&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Considered_harmful&quot;&gt;considered harmful&lt;/a&gt;
and doesn&apos;t truly exist in many languages, including Python and JavaScript.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&apos;s so hard that no one seems to have done it in any usable capacity. Take this small example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do you do with big, twice used expressions?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Store a variable? What do you name it? When do you initialize it?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What do you do when control arbitrarily goes back to an earlier part of the graph?
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You can&apos;t use &lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot;&gt;goto&lt;/code&gt; in Python or JavaScript, you would need to build a state machine device&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So my theory is that the intertia of all these textual languages has prevented builders from
investing in a visual language that can match them. Textual languages are the norm and people
seem to think &quot;you can either learn to code or you can&apos;t code&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then why do people keep building a brand new, limited-scope visual language,
but then also adding Python bindings to their projects?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If only there were a visual language that could be embedded anywhere! (wink, wink).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can visual languages not suck?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think so! I think they almost all leave something to be desired compared to textual languages,
but I think that&apos;s because most people implementing them haven&apos;t taken them seriously enough.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visual graph is in many ways just a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_graph&quot;&gt;Control Flow Graph&lt;/a&gt; for a compiler.
You could easily make it performant, even compile it to native code such that it&apos;s lightning fast. You don&apos;t even have to
write a parser (the easy part tbh).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, the hard part is that people keep trying to make a visual script that can convert to an existing programming language and back.
We have a large group of text-editor trained
people (programmers) who want to write their code in text (I am one of them), and we have a large(r) group of
people who don&apos;t want the overhead of learning a 60 year-old paradigm of text input invented under the baggage of
punch cards, teletype machines, and terminals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They just want to click on an integer output and be able to search through the list of functions that apply to integers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So if we can make a language that both kinds of people can edit, be it text, or visual, &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; also make it embeddable,
then I think we&apos;re getting close to the holy grail of visual scripting.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The dream of the visual &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; textual language&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe we can introduce a &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; textual programming language which
lets us save our programs textually to a sane, language-like format for text editing,
and then load them back in a graph! We just need to extend existing languages with some new pieces to
make it possible to represent graphs intuitively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will allow both traditional text-editor-using programmers and non-programmer low-code users to work together
and customize or integrate their applications in ways that today is inhibited by that sociotechnical divide.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One fly in this ointment that I will discuss in a future post, is the problem of encoding graph node positions
in the textual language, especially if there are people editing this code only via text. Yikes!
I will definitely explain some approaches later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we can achieve this truly &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isomorphism&quot;&gt;isomorphic&lt;/a&gt; language though, I believe optimistically
it can bring us closer to the dream of truly extensible applications!
Today, 99% of browser users will never script a browser extension even if they have to work with a website daily where they need
to click something 100 times to get their work done.
There&apos;s just too much to learn to create something as simple as an &quot;open selected image in photoshop&quot; button.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think the gap will be narrowed significantly if a new visual-first programming language can co-exist with the likes
of Python and JavaScript. And if you&apos;re thinking about AI, I don&apos;t think it
precludes the need for this kind of language.
In fact, I think AI makes it even more useful&lt;super&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#footnote3&quot;&gt;2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/super&gt;
as less technical people start writing ---and debugging--- more code.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Graphl&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So all this is really so much fluff to introduce &lt;a href=&quot;https://graphl.tech&quot;&gt;graphl&lt;/a&gt;, what I am designing as
an answer to these problems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TODO: show how Graphl solves the above problems&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;By designing a language explicitly for textual and visual interpretation, and applying the lessons of
modern software tooling, I believe we can introduce a newcomer to the scripting space that can bring
coding to people never before.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have seen visual scripting languages inspire smart but code-hating people (architects, game
developers, engineers), and I want to break visual scripting from the chains of their hosts,
and let people make applications extensible with an easy, reusable, standardized language.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel the same way, please, &lt;a href=&quot;https://graphl.tech/app&quot;&gt;try Graphl&lt;/a&gt;, and reach out to me with
how you might want to use it! I want it to be used for everything!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Do you think I got something wrong? Please feel free to
&lt;a href=&quot;me@mikemikeb.com&quot;&gt;email&lt;/a&gt; me to help me make corrections.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Footnotes:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;footnote1&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; Open the &quot;beta&quot; warning block to read it &lt;a href=&quot;https://studio.retejs.org/&quot;&gt;https://studio.retejs.org/&lt;/a&gt;.
It truly is a challenging thing so I don&apos;t blame them, you&apos;re converting to a language with separate semantics and potentially
backwards, while trying to be readable on both ends...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;footnote2&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; I will not go into detail right now about AI and coding, many seem to believe that the dawn of
english-only coding is near, but here is my overall thinking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would suggest the evidence is pointing to us still needing well trained humans deeply involved in the process until
today&apos;s AI compute load becomes significantly cheaper (and uses clean energy).
The current trajectory of &quot;better&quot; AI seems to include &quot;spend catastrophic amounts of compute to invoke the LLM hundreds of times
for 50% more (decaying) accuracy in each iteration&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, a small browser extension might be doable, but I think most built-only-by-AI projects will rot, and still need debugging by
humans. And a visual language&apos;s debugger will be &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; easier for the less technically endowed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why are there no very popular visual scripting languages?
You may know the answer here already. There are tons!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is a sample of some different visual scripting systems, some you may have heard of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/modeling/geometry_nodes/index.html&quot;&gt;Blender nodes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.epicgames.com/documentation/en-us/unreal-engine/introduction-to-blueprints-visual-scripting-in-unreal-engine&quot;&gt;Unreal Engine Blueprints&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://developers.google.com/blockly/&quot;&gt;Scratch/Google Blockly&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.grasshopper3d.com/page/tutorials-1&quot;&gt;Grasshopper&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://unit.software&quot;&gt;unit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/IndiePython/nodezator&quot;&gt;nodezator&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;every no-code workflow engine ever&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And they don&apos;t suck, although maybe some parts of some of them do. So a better question then is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- TODO: different font --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why can you use languages like JavaScript or Python in websites, browser extensions, servers,

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&apos;ve seen few attempts and little success with the last approach. And on top of that, they&apos;re now converting to a
non-visual language like JavaScript with its own complex semantics. The simple interpreter approach is easy but slow,
and I think just a consequence of the project goals, so I think we can ignore it for now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But why is it hard to convert graphs into languages like JavaScript and Python?
I plan to answer that in more detail in a future post.
For now, I&apos;ll answer the question of can they not suck?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Can they not suck?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think so!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The visual graph is in many ways just a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control-flow_graph&quot;&gt;Control Flow Graph&lt;/a&gt; inside a compiler.
You could easily make it performant, even compile it to native code such that it&apos;s lightning fast. You don&apos;t even have to

&lt;p&gt;The hard part is that some people want to be able to convert to a real programming language and back.
Why do people want that? I think it&apos;s a social problem. We have a large group of text-editor trained
people (programmers) who want to write their code in text (I am one of them now), and we have a large(r) group of
people who don&apos;t want the overhead of learning a 60 year-old paradigm of text input invented under the baggage of

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They just want to click on an integer output and be able to search through the list of functions that apply to integers.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The dream of the isomorphic visual &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; textual language&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I believe we can introduce a &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; textual programming language which
lets us &lt;em&gt;serialize&lt;/em&gt; (save) our programs textually to a sane, language-like format for text editing,
and then load them back in a graph! We just need to extend existing languages with some new pieces to
make it possible to represent graphs intuitively.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This will allow both traditional text-editor-using programmers and non-programmer low-code users to work together
and customize or integrate their applications in ways that today is inhibited by that sociotechnical divide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Problems to solve&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why are graph-to-language compilers hard?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so I mentioned briefly we need a new language. Why can&apos;t we use current languages?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are several reasons:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;it&apos;s tempting to use the language&apos;s AST as the visual graph, but ASTs are &lt;em&gt;Abstract Syntax TREES&lt;/em&gt;, they aren&apos;t graphs,
and they were not designed for intuitive visual use. Even generalizations of the AST are not intuitive, you basically
have to know how the underlying language works&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In a truly graph-like visual scripting language you can intuitively jump back to previous code sections,
but the equivalent in programming languages &lt;em&gt;goto&lt;/em&gt; is &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Considered_harmful&quot;&gt;considered harmful&lt;/a&gt;
and doesn&apos;t truly exist in many languages, including Python/JavaScript.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;using data twice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, consider how someone might convert the following graph to JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ok, so maybe data isn&apos;t the problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;using code twice&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an example, consider how someone might convert the following graph to JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- --&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How do you go back to the other code after?
Without goto, in JavaScript you have to implement your own state machine, which is...
not really how a JavaScript programmer would ever do it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;gatsby-highlight&quot; data-language=&quot;ts&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;language-ts&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ts&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;graph&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;input&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; integer&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; integer &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; state&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;done&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; counter &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;state &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;!==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;done&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;switch&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;state&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;counter &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
                    &lt;span class=&quot;token function&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
                    counter &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;-=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

                    state &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
                &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

            &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;case&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token number&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

                state &lt;span class=&quot;token operator&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token string&quot;&gt;&quot;done&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;token keyword&quot;&gt;break&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;token punctuation&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if you&apos;re a programmer, you might be thinking, &quot;Hey, that&apos;s just a while loop!&quot;.
But someone just writing an algorithm intuitively without knowing structured programming,
might hear about a while loop and say, &quot;Hey! That&apos;s just a jump back to the condition!&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So-called &quot;structured programming&quot; is less important when you can literally see the control
flow graph in front of you...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Isomorphism&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And after all that difficulty turning graphs into high-level code, some people really want to be able to convert
that javascript &lt;em&gt;back&lt;/em&gt; into the original graph! How preposterous...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&apos;s what an isomorphism is, a conversion of something from one form into another, that is perfectly reversible
without losing any detail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine taking the above state machine JavaScript code and converting it back into a graph. Doable? Perhaps...
Will your compiler convert all while+switch state machines into graph code?
What if someone added a new state?
What if they refactored it to not use a state machine?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What about a new language?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Control flow&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Why Lisp&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Lisp macros&lt;/h2&gt;

It truly is a challenging thing so I don&apos;t blame them, you&apos;re converting to a language with separate semantics and potentially
backwards, while trying to be readable on both ends...&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span id=&quot;footnote2&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; I will not go into detail right now about AI and coding, many seem to believe that the dawn of
english-only coding is near, but here is my overall thinking:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I would suggest the evidence is pointing to us still needing well trained humans deeply involved in the process until
today&apos;s AI compute load becomes significantly cheaper (and uses clean energy).
The current trajectory of &quot;better&quot; AI seems to include &quot;spend catastrophic amounts of compute to invoke the LLM hundreds of times
for 50% more (decaying) accuracy in each iteration&quot;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, a small browser extension might be doable, but I think most built-only-by-AI projects will rot, and still need debugging by
humans. And a visual language&apos;s debugger will be &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; easier for the less technically endowed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A long time ago, I didn&apos;t program.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In fact, I only scraped some Python for loops together to automate some stuff in Blender,
with much help from my dad, and it was beyond me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;img src=&quot;https://mikemikeb.com/images/the-eye.png&quot; alt=&quot;mike&apos;s procedural eye&quot;/&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, while still quite young, I learned about Unreal Engine blueprints.
I was already programming by then so I didn&apos;t like them much, but I met several animators,
game developers, and later in the Architecture-Engineering-Construction industry several
architects who swore by this thing. I met (and led a team of) people making entire projects
that pretty much only used visual script. And they vastly preferred it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I dreamed that I would never have to edit these things myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized eventually that text editing is the barrier. Text editing is an old vestige
of the technological transitions that brought us todays intuitive computers. And I even
think it&apos;s very efficient once learnt and combined with good tooling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I believe that the gap between visual languages and textual languages is an
imagined one. And I intend to lead the design of this language to prove it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This language will be &lt;em&gt;isomorphic&lt;/em&gt; to a visual representation. Meaning you can edit
one format and it will cleanly change the other, automatically. So people can choose
whichever format they prefer and still work together!&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
