I met (and led a team of) people making entire projects\nthat pretty much only used visual script. And they vastly preferred it.</p>\n<p>And I dreamed that I would never have to edit these things myself.</p>\n<p>I realized eventually that text editing is the barrier. Text editing is an old vestige\nof the technological transitions that brought us todays intuitive computers. And I even\nthink it's very efficient once learnt and combined with good tooling.</p>\n<p>Now I believe that the gap between visual languages and textual languages is an\nimagined one. And I intend to lead the design of this language to prove it.</p>\n<p>This language will be <em>isomorphic</em> to a visual representation. Meaning you can edit\none format and it will cleanly change the other, automatically. So people can choose\nwhichever format they prefer and still work together!</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"How I came up with Graphl","path":"/blog/how-I-came-up-with-graphl","date":"November 21, 2024"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/blog/HowICameUpWithGraphl/"}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
