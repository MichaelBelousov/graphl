## Prompt:

Create a React and next.js static website.
The landing page should have on the left the text "Code?" over a sample text editor showing some lisp code,
and on the right the text "No Code?" over a react-flow based demo of a similar algorithm.
Then beneath, it says, "Why not both?" in large text, and in smaller text "Go on, edit it, you know you want to"

Scrolling past that screen-sized page, will be 3 interesting but simple sample usages of visual scripting.
