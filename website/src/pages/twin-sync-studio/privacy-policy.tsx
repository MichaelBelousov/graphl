        Cookies: We may collect information from you through automatic tracking systems
        (such as information about your browsing preferences) as well as through information
        that you volunteer to us (such as information that you provide during a registration
        process or at other times while using the Website, as described above).
        For example, we use cookies to make your browsing experience easier and more
        intuitive: cookies are small strings of text used to store some information that may
        concern the user, his or her preferences or the device they are using to access the

        and does not transmit viruses.
        Cookies do not record or store any Personal Data. If you want, you can prevent the use
        of cookies, but then you may not be able to use our Website as we intend. To proceed
        without changing the options related to cookies, simply continue to use our Website.
