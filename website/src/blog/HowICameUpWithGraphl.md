TODO: finish this blog

A long time ago, I didn't program.

In fact, I only scraped some Python for loops together to automate some stuff in Blender,
with much help from my dad, and it was beyond me.

Then, while still quite young, I learned about Unreal Engine blueprints.
I was already programming by then so I didn't like them much, but I met several animators,
game developers, and later in the Architecture-Engineering-Construction industry several
architects who swore by this thing. I met (and led a team of) people making entire projects
that pretty much only used visual script. And they vastly preferred it.

And I dreamed that I would never have to edit these things myself.

I realized eventually that text editing is the barrier. Text editing is an old vestige
of the technological transitions that brought us todays intuitive computers. And I even
think it's very efficient once learnt and combined with good tooling.

Now I believe that the gap between visual languages and textual languages is an
imagined one. And I intend to lead the design of this language to prove it.

This language will be _isomorphic_ to a visual representation. Meaning you can edit
one format and it will cleanly change the other, automatically. So people can choose
whichever format they prefer and still work together!
